  - ⏳ Pending (default)
  - ✅ Approved
  - ❌ Rejected
  - 🚫 Cancelled
  - ✅ Completed
- ✅ **Action Buttons**: 
  - **Approve**: For pending appointments
  - **Reject**: For pending appointments
  - **Complete**: For approved appointments
- ✅ **Summary Statistics**: Real-time counts for total, pending, approved, and rejected appointments

### 🎯 **2. Patient Dashboard Updates**
- ✅ **Enhanced Appointment Display**: Updated appointment cards to show approval status prominently

  - `PUT /api/hospital/appointments/:appointmentId/complete` - Mark appointment as completed
- ✅ **Data Population**: Hospital appointments endpoint populates patient details (name, email, phone)
