# üîß Fix Hospital Details - Get Real Data Working

## üö® Current Issue
Your hospital details page is showing "Not specified" and "N/A" because:
1. The hospital ID is not being passed correctly from the patient dashboard
2. The API calls are working but data structure needs adjustment

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Solution

### 1. **Test Your APIs First**
Open: http://localhost:8090/test-api.html
- This will verify all your API endpoints are working
- You should see real hospital data from MongoDB

### 2. **Check Browser Console**
1. Open your patient dashboard
2. Go to Buying Comparison tab
3. Click "View Details" on any hospital card
4. Check browser console for debugging messages

### 3. **Verify Data Flow**
The data flow should be:
```
Patient Dashboard ‚Üí Click "View Details" ‚Üí hospital-details.html?id=HOSPITAL_ID ‚Üí API Call ‚Üí Display Data
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Status Check

### **What's Working:**
‚úÖ Medical Services API: Returns 3 services with hospital data
‚úÖ Hospital Details API: Returns complete hospital information
‚úÖ Hospital Services API: Returns services for specific hospital

### **Sample Data Available:**
- **City General Hospital** (ID: 68b6dc732b6f5432806d6e0c)
- **Metro Medical Center** (ID: 68b6dc732b6f5432806d6e0d)  
- **Regional Heart Institute** (ID: 68b6dc732b6f5432806d6e15)

## üîç Debugging Steps

### **Step 1: Check Hospital Mapping**
In browser console, you should see:
```
Mapped hospital: City General Hospital -> 68b6dc732b6f5432806d6e0c
Mapped hospital: Metro Medical Center -> 68b6dc732b6f5432806d6e0d
Mapped hospital: Regional Heart Institute -> 68b6dc732b6f5432806d6e15
Final hospital mapping: {City General Hospital: "68b6dc732b6f5432806d6e0c", ...}
```

### **Step 2: Check View Details Click**
When you click "View Details", you should see:
```
Clicked View Details for hospital: City General Hospital
Available hospital mapping: {City General Hospital: "68b6dc732b6f5432806d6e0c", ...}
Found hospital ID: 68b6dc732b6f5432806d6e0c
```

### **Step 3: Check Hospital Details Page**
In the new tab, check console for:
```
Loading hospital details for ID: 68b6dc732b6f5432806d6e0c
Hospital response status: 200
Hospital data received: {success: true, hospital: {...}}
Services response status: 200
Services data received: [...]
```

## üõ†Ô∏è If Data Still Shows "Not specified"

    "staffCount": 1200,
    "annualPatients": 15000,
    "accreditation": "Joint Commission Accredited",
    "emergencyServices": true
  }
}
```

### **Check Services API Response**
The services API returns:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "services": [
    {
      "serviceName": "Cardiac Surgery",
      "category": "cardiology",
      "price": {"min": 25000, "max": 35000},
      "waitTime": "2-3 weeks",
      "successRate": 95,
      "rating": 4.8,
      "totalRatings": 150
    }
  ]
}
```
